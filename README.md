# Motion Detection Arduino Project

A simple motion detection system using a PIR sensor to control an LED.

**Testing**: PIR SENSOR.
## Hardware Setup to test your PIR sensor to detect motion.

| Component | Arduino Pin |
|-----------|------------|
| PIR Sensor | 6 |
| LED Cathode | 13 |

## How It Works

The PIR sensor detects motion and triggers the LED:
- **Motion Detected**: LED turns ON → Serial output shows timestamp
- **Motion Ended**: LED turns OFF → Serial output shows timestamp

## PIN Configuration

- **PIR Pin**: Must be connected to pin **6**
- **PIR Pin**:VCC Must be connected to pin **5V**
- **PIR Pin**:GND Must be connected to pin **GND**
- **LED Pin**: Cathode must be connected to pin **13**
- **LED Pin**: Anode must be connected to pin **GND**

## LED States when motion is detected.

## Getting Started

1. Connect PIR sensor to pin 6
2. Connect LED cathode to pin 13
3. Upload `motion-detection.ino` to your Arduino board
4. Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud) to view motion events
